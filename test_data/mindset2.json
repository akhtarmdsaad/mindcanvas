The 'Contact Us' form isn't for support; it's a blind entry point to the internal employee admin panel (Blind XSS).\n2. The 'Currency Converter' isn't for math; it's a float-precision error generator.\n3. The 'PDF Export' button isn't for printing; it's a server-side browser you can trick into reading local files (SSRF).\n4.
